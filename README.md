# Introduction
This is a fork of casper implementing google's suggestions for progressive web apps https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/
In ghost 0.9 it's possible to add a manifest.json in root, so there are no other obstacles left to implement app like behavior in ghost themes.
This is a work in progress - the service worker is pretty much copy pasted and doesn't do anything intelligent yet.

This probably won't work with subdirectories yet.
